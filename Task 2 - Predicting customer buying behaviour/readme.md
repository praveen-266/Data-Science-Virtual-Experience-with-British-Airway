### Task Overview

- Explored and prepared the dataset:
  - Spent time exploring the dataset using the "Getting Started" Jupyter Notebook in the Resources section.
  - Gathered insights about different columns and basic statistics of the dataset.
  - Considered creating new features to enhance the predictive model.
  - Utilized the provided Resources to assist with dataset exploration and preparation.

- Trained a machine learning model:
  - Prepared the dataset for modeling.
  - Used an algorithm, such as RandomForest, that provides information on variable contributions to the model's predictive power.
  - Trained a machine learning model to predict the target outcome of a customer making a booking.

- Evaluated model and presented findings:
  - Conducted cross-validation to assess the model's performance.
  - Generated appropriate evaluation metrics to gauge the model's effectiveness.
  - Created visualizations to interpret the contribution of each variable to the model.
  - Summarized findings in a single slide to be shared with the manager.
  - Utilized the provided "PowerPoint Template" in the Resources section to create the summary.
  - Utilized the provided links to assist with this task.
