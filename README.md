# British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience Programme

Welcome to the British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience Programme! ðŸ›«

## Overview

The British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience Programme is an immersive and hands-on opportunity to delve into the exciting world of data science within the aviation industry. This virtual experience offers aspiring data scientists a chance to work on real-world projects and gain valuable insights into the airline's operations.

## What to Expect

During this programme, you will be exposed to a series of challenging tasks that will take you through the complete data science workflow:

1. **Explore and Prepare the Dataset:** Begin by diving into the dataset and gaining an in-depth understanding of its structure, columns, and basic statistics. Take advantage of the "Getting Started" Jupyter Notebook and Resources provided to make data exploration and preparation a seamless process.

2. **Predicting Customer Buying Behaviour:** Get ready for the core of the programme, where you will be tasked with predicting customer booking behavior. Use machine learning algorithms like RandomForest to build a predictive model that uncovers valuable insights.

3. **Evaluate Model and Present Findings:** After training your predictive model, it's time to evaluate its performance using cross-validation and appropriate evaluation metrics. Create visualizations to interpret how each variable contributes to the model's predictions. Finally, summarize your findings in a concise and impactful manner, ready for presentation.
